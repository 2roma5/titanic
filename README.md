This is a compilation of my attempts in the [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition from Kaggle. I'll be using Aurélien Géron's methodology, described in his book: [_Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (3rd edition)_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/).

Each attempt is organized as follows:
* eda.ipynb\
This notebook contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA). I examine, visualize and apply transformations that may improve model performance.

* model.ipynb\
Here, I experiment with various models and evaluate them using different metrics. Based on the results, I select the most promising model. 

* predictions.ipynb\
In this notebook, I load the final model and generate a .csv file with the predictions, ready for submission to Kaggle.
